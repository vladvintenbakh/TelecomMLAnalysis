# Telecom Churn Prediction Analysis

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyze customer data from a telecom company to understand patterns of churn (customers leaving the service). By predicting the churn rate, the business can take proactive measures to retain clients who are likely to leave, which is generally more cost-effective than acquiring new customers. The analysis aims to develop models that can predict customer churn based on historical interaction data and demographic information.

### Methods Used
* Exploratory Data Analysis

* Descriptive Statistics
* Predictive Modeling
* Machine Learning (Classification)

### Technologies
* Python
* Jupyter
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Plotly

## Project Description
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and develops predictive models to understand and forecast telecom customer churn. The dataset contains various customer attributes such as demographics, service usage, billing information, and contract types, which are analyzed to uncover relationships and trends that contribute to customer churn.

Key areas of focus include:
1. Exploring demographic and service usage factors that contribute to churn.
2. Building machine learning models to predict churn based on customer attributes.
3. Comparing the accuracy and performance of different machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests).
4. Visualizing the significant factors influencing customer retention.

## Project Needs
- Data exploration and descriptive statistics
- Data processing/cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning model development
- Data visualization
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Writeup/reporting
